MANUAL FIX COMMANDS FOR NEXT.JS/TURBOPACK BUILD ERROR
=====================================================

Run these commands in order to fix the "Can't resolve '../../../shared/lib/utils/warn-once'" error:

1. Remove parent lockfile (if exists):
   rm -f /c/Users/marin/package-lock.json
   rm -rf /c/Users/marin/node_modules

2. Clean project build artifacts:
   cd "C:\Users\marin\OneDrive\Desktop\3js_port\three-starter"
   rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json

3. Clean npm cache:
   npm cache clean --force

4. Install dependencies:
   npm install

5. Verify React installation (should show single version):
   npm ls react

6. Start development server:
   npm run dev

ALTERNATIVE: Use the automated scripts
=====================================

For Command Prompt:
   fix-build-error.bat

For PowerShell:
   .\fix-build-error.ps1

WHAT THIS FIXES:
================

The error occurs because:
- Next.js/Turbopack is trying to resolve from wrong workspace root
- Parent directory has package-lock.json causing conflicts
- React version mismatches between dependencies
- Corrupted build artifacts

The fix:
- Removes parent lockfile and node_modules
- Cleans all build artifacts
- Uses stable React 18 stack with compatible R3F versions
- Forces Turbopack to use correct root directory
- Ensures single React version throughout dependency tree

EXPECTED RESULT:
================

After running the fix:
- Development server starts without errors
- Three.js scene loads properly
- Material editor works with real-time controls
- Smooth scrolling functions correctly
- All sections snap properly

If you still get errors after this fix, check:
1. Node.js is properly installed (version 18+)
2. You're running from the correct project directory
3. No other npm processes are running
